- NumPy provides the foundational n-dimensional array object for efficient numerical computations, serving as the core data structure that nearly all other data science libraries in Python are built upon. 

- Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis, providing easy-to-use data structures (DataFrames) for working with structured, tabular data like spreadsheets or database tables. 

- TensorFlow and PyTorch are both open-source machine learning frameworks used for building and training complex models, especially deep neural networks, with PyTorch being favoured for research and prototyping due to its flexibility, while TensorFlow is often preferred for large-scale production deployment.
