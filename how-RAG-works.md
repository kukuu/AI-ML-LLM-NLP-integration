# RAG

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced AI framework that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to enhance the quality and accuracy of responses in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. At its core, RAG integrates a retrieval component that fetches relevant information from a large external knowledge base (e.g., Wikipedia, proprietary databases) and a generative component that uses this retrieved information to produce coherent and contextually accurate responses. 

This hybrid approach allows RAG to leverage the strengths of both retrieval (access to vast, up-to-date information) and generation (flexibility in crafting nuanced responses), making it particularly effective for tasks like question answering, content creation, and conversational AI.

## The RAG Workflow

The RAG workflow begins with the retrieval component, which uses a dense retrieval model (e.g., based on embeddings) to search for the most relevant documents or passages from the knowledge base. These retrieved documents are then passed to the generative component, typically a transformer-based language model (e.g., GPT, T5), which synthesizes the information to generate a final response. 

By grounding its responses in external knowledge, RAG reduces the risk of generating incorrect or hallucinated information, making it more reliable for real-world applications. This combination of retrieval and generation enables RAG to deliver context-aware, accurate, and informative outputs, bridging the gap between purely generative models and traditional retrieval systems.
