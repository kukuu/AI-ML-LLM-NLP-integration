# AI Systems Architected & Developed

Over the past two years, I have architected and delivered end-to-end AI systems, most notably the SPYDER platform, an AI-driven energy tariff comparison engine. This involved developing a scalable cloud architecture and implementing a full-stack solution that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to intelligently analyse complex tariff data and provide personalised consumer recommendations. The system operates as a real-time quoting engine, demonstrating my practical expertise in building applied AI that directly automates complex decision-making processes and enhances user experience.

My development approach consistently focuses on creating production-ready, intelligent workflows. This is evidenced in my work on AI-ML-LLM-NLP integration, where I have leveraged technologies like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and LangChain to build and operationalise models. This hands-on experience, from data ingestion and model training to deployment via MLOps practices, has enabled me to deliver measurable efficiency gains, such as automating manual analysis and improving data-driven insights for critical business functions.
